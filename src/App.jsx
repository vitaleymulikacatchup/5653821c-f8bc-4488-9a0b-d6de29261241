        To convert the provided HTML to JSX, you need to adjust the syntax to fit React's requirements, particularly when it comes to the use of class names and inline styles. 

Hereâ€™s how you can convert the `<section>` element from your example to JSX:

<section 
  aria-label="Notifications alt+T" 
  tabIndex="-1" 
  aria-live="polite" 
  aria-relevant="additions text" 
  aria-atomic="false">
</section>
### Key Changes:
1. **`class` to `className`:** In JSX, the `class` attribute is replaced with `className`.
2. **Inline Styles:** Inline styles in JSX are represented as an object. For example, `style="color: red;"` becomes `style={{color: 'red'}}`.

This particular section does not have a `class` or `style`, but these rules would apply if they were present.
